The tool must abstract interactions with: - macOS Keychain via `security` command. - Linux systems with `libsecret` via `secret-tool`. - Windows Credential Manager via PowerShell cmdlets (simulated or called if in WSL/Windows). If a native keychain is unavailable or fails, the CLI must fall back to using GPG encryption for storing tokens in a local file. This GPG fallback requires: - User to specify a GPG recipient key ID. - Encryption of tokens before writing to a file. - Decryption of tokens when retrieving (requiring the user's GPG key and passphrase). The CLI should support: - Storing a token for a given service name and account/user identifier. - Retrieving a token for a given service name and account. - Deleting a token. - Listing stored service/account pairs (metadata only, not tokens themselves). - Graceful error handling for keychain access failures, GPG errors, or missing tools. - Non-interactive mode for GPG decryption if GPG agent is configured or passphrase is provided via a secure mechanism (e.g. env var - for testing/CI only)."
