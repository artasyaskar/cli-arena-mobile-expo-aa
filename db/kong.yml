# This is a placeholder for Kong's declarative configuration.
# For local Supabase development, Supabase CLI typically manages Kong configuration.
# If you need to customize Kong beyond what Supabase CLI provides,
# you can define your services, routes, plugins, etc., here.

# Example (illustrative, not necessarily needed for basic Supabase setup):
# _format_version: "2.1"
#
# services:
# - name: my-custom-service
#   url: http://my-upstream-api:8080
#   routes:
#   - name: my-custom-route
#     paths:
#     - /my-custom-path

# Refer to Kong documentation for details on declarative configuration:
# https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/declarative-config/
#
# For Supabase, it's often easier to let the Supabase CLI handle Kong.
# This file is included primarily to satisfy the volume mount in docker-compose.yml.
# You might not need to populate it unless you have advanced Kong customization needs.

# An empty file is often sufficient if Supabase CLI handles all Kong config.
# Or you can remove the volume mount from docker-compose.yml if this file is not used.
