    # TODO: Add setup for Swift if iOS tests are run directly on CI (requires macOS runner)
    # If using a macOS runner:
    # - name: Select Xcode version

    - name: Install project dependencies (Placeholder)
      run: echo "CI - Placeholder for npm install or make setup"
      # This will be replaced by `make setup` once the Makefile is robust.
      # For now, let's assume 'make setup' might involve Docker-specific commands
      # that are better run after Docker is set up, or it might be too early for it.

        echo "CI - Placeholder for starting Supabase via Docker Compose"
        # This would be something like:
        # docker-compose up -d db auth rest realtime storage-api kong
        # Need to ensure Supabase is ready before proceeding.
        # Supabase CLI 'supabase start' might be an option if CLI is installed in CI env.

    - name: Lint code (Placeholder)
      run: echo "CI - Placeholder for make lint"
      # This will be `make lint`

    - name: Run tests (Placeholder)
      run: echo "CI - Placeholder for make test"
      # This will be `make test`

    #     # docker-compose down
    #
    # Note: For a full `make setup -> make lint -> make test` sequence that
    # relies on Docker Compose, the CI job might need to:
    # 1. Build the 'app' Docker image.
    # 2. Run `docker-compose up -d` for all services.
    # 3. Execute `make` targets, potentially using `docker-compose exec app make ...`.
    # This initial setup is simplified and will be expanded.
    # For now, we'll focus on getting the Makefile targets working locally.
    # The CI will be updated to accurately reflect the `make` commands.
    # The current placeholders assume that linting/testing might not *yet* depend on a running Supabase instance.

    #   run: make build # Assuming 'make build' also builds the Docker image for 'app' or handles it

    #     # Add a script here to check health of Supabase services, e.g., polling db.
    #     # Supabase CLI's `supabase status` might be useful if run within the context
    #     # of the Supabase project, or custom checks against exposed ports.
    #     sleep 30 # Temporary crude wait
