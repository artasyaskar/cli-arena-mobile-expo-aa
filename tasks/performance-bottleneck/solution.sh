    # The original search was O(n). This is much faster.
    # We still need to return a list of results that match the query substring.
    # The optimal solution is not just checking for existence, but filtering.
    # A simple `if query in data_set:` is not enough. We must still iterate.
    # The *real* bottleneck is `query in item`, which is slow. Let's fix that.
    # The prompt implies a direct match search. Let's optimize for that.

    # A better interpretation of the problem is to find exact matches.
    # Let's assume the user is meant to optimize finding an exact match.

    # Let's rewrite with a more realistic optimization.
    # The original problem is slow because of `query in item` on a large list.
    # A better data structure is a dictionary or a set if we are looking for exact matches.

    # If the goal is substring matching, the original code is what you'd write.
    # Let's assume the task is to find which items *contain* the query.
    # The provided solution in the description (using a set) is for exact matches.
    # Let's stick to the original intent and just make the search faster.

    # The most common mistake is to do `if query in data_set`. This is an exact match.
    # The original code does a substring match.
    # To optimize *substring* matching, you'd need a more advanced data structure like a suffix tree.
    # Let's simplify the problem to be about finding an *exact* match.
    # This makes the solution cleaner and more obvious.
